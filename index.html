      The SR-71 was developed as a black project from the Lockheed A-12
      reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's Skunk Works
      division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly" Johnson was
      responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of
      the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first
      aircraft to be designed with a reduced radar cross-section. Initially, a
      bomber variant of the A-12 was requested by Curtis LeMay, before the
      program was focused solely on reconnaissance. Mission equipment for the
      reconnaissance role included signals intelligence sensors, side looking
      airborne radar, and a camera;[2] the SR-71 was both longer and heavier
      than the A-12, allowing it to hold more fuel as well as a two-seat
      cockpit. The SR-71's existence was revealed to the public on 24 July 1964,
      and entered service in January 1966.

      During aerial reconnaissance missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds
      and altitudes (Mach 3.2 and 85,000 feet, 25,900 meters), allowing it to
      outrace or entirely avoid threats.[2] If a surface-to-air missile launch
      was detected, the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and
      outpace the missile.[4] On average, each SR-71 could fly once per week due
      to the extended turnaround required after mission recovery. A total of 32
      aircraft were built; 12 were lost in accidents with none lost to enemy
      action.[5][6] In 1989, the USAF retired the SR-71 largely for political
      reasons; several were briefly reactivated during the 1990s before their
      second retirement in 1998. NASA was the final operator of the Blackbird,
      who used it as a research platform, retiring it in 1999.[7] Since its
      retirement, the SR-71's role has been taken up by a combination of
      reconnaissance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); a proposed
      UAV successor, the SR-72, is under development by Lockheed Martin, and
      scheduled to fly in 2025.[8] The SR-71 has several nicknames, including
      "Blackbird" and "Habu".[9] As of 2023 the SR-71 holds the world record it
      set in 1976 as the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft, previously held
      by the related Lockheed YF-12.
